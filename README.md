# Water Level Controller
A water level controller is a device which is used to detect the amount of water present in the tank and alert the user for low or dangerously high water level. It has a wide set of applications such as water and sewer services for office and apartment buildings, industrial applications for iron and steel, food, chemical, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries.

## Objective 
The objective of the project was to design a water controller that can:-
 - Monitor the level of water and switch on the supply when the tank is empty and switch off the supply when the tank is full.
 - Alert the user while doing so.
 - To make sure to save as much as water and energy as possible.
 
 ## Existing Solutions
 The types of water level indicators are:-
  - Floatless level indicators
  - Single point level indicators
  - Hanging water level sensors
  - Spark plug water level indicators
  - PVC water level sensors
  - Swimming water level sensors 
   
  ### Floatless level indicators
  Floatless relays are level controllers that detect water levels based on the conductivity of the medium measured by using conductive electrodes. When a relay senses the liquid level measured, the output contacts of the relay are energized and latched.
  
  ### Single point level indicators
  Point level switches are often used as a warning indicator to trigger an alert when a fluid level is either too high or too low within a tank or vessel. A single point level switch detects if a predetermined single liquid level is reached and actuates a switch to notify a user. Single point level switches are available in multiple sensing technologies including float, electro-optic, ultrasonic, capacitive, and water in fuel.
  
  ### Hanging water level sensors
  Universal Hanging sensors can be used in the cases where there is not enough over head clearance to allow for the solid sensor rods we typically would like to see. Each sensor is set and secured with a conventional compression fitting to insure it stays at the correct level and is also color coded so it can be Identified all the way through to the Control panel.
  
  ### Spark plug water level indicators
  The only Solid-state all Electronic Float switch with no moving parts. It works in any water environment where float switches are used.

  ### PVC water level sensors
  Alternatives to electronic float switches and use no moving parts.They work in any water environment where you would use float switches. Itâ€™s press in plug and presses into its respective spell styled coupler.
  
  ### Swimming water level sensors
  Pool water level control sensors work by using 2 rods that come into contact with the pool waters surface. The energized sensor rods close the water filler valve by making a circuit when both sensors are in contact with the water. When the water level drops below one of the rods it opens up the circuit and turns on the automatic pool filler valve. The auto fill valve will stop filling again once both water level sensors are in contact with the pool water surface again. 

 ### Disadvantages
 The shortcomings of the water controllers and float switches in the market are:-
  - Water level controls need to be replaced every 3 years.
  - The floats in float switches would rust, foul and deteriorate
  - Electronics are usually required to be built separately
  - More difficult installation
  - Most float switches are outdated
  - No LED indicator lights
  - No Warranty or Guarantee
 
## Working Principle
 Water is the conductor electricity. We use this principle to display messages on microcontroller, which are dipped in water, they detect electricity and subsequently send signal to the microcontroller indicating the level of water present in the tank and conveying whether the motor should be switched on or off.
